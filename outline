	Hi, I'm Andy, I'd like to show you a game engine I'm working on.
	
	This demo is the slides for a longer talk
	I'll skip most of it but if you'd like to play, here's the URL
	
	So. Voxels!
	Not just for minecraft, they're simply rasterized 3D data.
	Applicable for lots of uses and games, which I'll skip here.
	This game engine essentially solves the problem of drawing voxels quickly.
	
	Two quick points about doing this stuff in JS:
	
	1: Rendering voxels
		GPU only groks polygons, so you must convert voxels to polygon meshes
		(show wireframe)
		Using 2 tris/voxel would be too many draw calls
		But if you made the whole scene into one big mesh, it would be
			too mush work to redo when things change
		Solving this tradeoff is done with interesting algos (ry..

	Point 2: Performance in V8
		Obviously this all lives or dies depending on JS performance
		V8 is fast but temperamental. Getting great performance is 50% black magic.
		
		Key takeaways:
		1. Don't bother guessing what will be fast. It can't be done. Profile.
			Let the DevTools be your guide.
		2. Deopts are the main enemy 
			(take a profile and find the deopt icon)
			v8 has two engines, a fast and a slow one. Deopt is when v8 was trying to 
			run a hot function in the fast one, but gave up
			Deopts can can happen at bizarre times for bizarre reasons
			If all else fails, trace deopts.
